[preface]
== Preface

Welcome to the TaskGraph Reference Guide. This comprehensive documentation covers the architecture, design, and usage of the TaskGraph workflow orchestration framework.

TaskGraph provides a powerful, type-safe DSL for building complex workflow graphs with support for:

* **Declarative workflow definition** using Groovy DSL
* **Asynchronous execution** with promises and futures
* **Parallel processing** with configurable concurrency
* **Error handling and retry logic** built-in at every layer
* **Observability and monitoring** with event listeners
* **Security by default** with sandboxed execution
* **Extensibility** through SPI and custom implementations

=== Who Should Read This Guide

* **Developers** implementing workflows and data pipelines
* **Architects** designing distributed systems
* **DevOps Engineers** orchestrating complex operations
* **Library Consumers** extending TaskGraph for custom needs

=== How to Use This Guide

This guide is structured as a progressive learning experience:

. **Part I (Chapters 1-5)**: Foundation - Architecture, design philosophy, and core concepts
. **Part II (Chapters 6-8)**: Usage - Practical guides and examples
. **Part III (Chapters 9-10)**: Operations - Security, monitoring, and production deployment
. **Part IV (Chapters 11-13)**: Reference - Deep dive into components and task types

You can read sequentially or jump to specific chapters based on your needs.
